There are three code documents here.

# 'NCS_primary_format_v2.0.ipynb': 
To simulate the countries in the primary set, Counterfactual Analysis, and Scenario-based Analysis, using the GSI_and_cases_track_primary_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases.

# 'NCS_validatiaon_format_v2.0.ipynb':
To simulate the countries in the validation set, using the 'GSI_and_cases_track_validation_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases.

# 'NCS_robustness_check_format_v2.0.ipynb':
There are four models here:
1) (For countries in the primary set) Parameter analysis for M,  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track_primary_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of primary set countries.

2) (For countries in the primary set) Parameter analysis for transmission rate (beta),  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track_primary_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of primary set countries.

3) (For countries in the primary set) Compare the GSI and google mobility,  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track_primary_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases and 'Global_Mobility_Report.csv' for google mobility data. The file of Google mobility data is too large to upload here, but it is available to dowload for everyone at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ .

4) Calculate the average error, using the 'GSI_and_cases_track_primary_set.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of primary set countries, and using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of validation set countries.

There are three code documents here.

# 'Final_version_for_covid19_tosubmitNCS': 
To simulate the countries in the primary set, Counterfactual Analysis, and Scenario-based Analysis, using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases.

# 'Five_ new_countries_silmuation':
To simulate the countries in the validation set, using the 'owid-covid-data.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases.

# ' NCS_robustness_check':
There are four models here:
1) Parameter analysis for M,  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and cases of primary set countries.
2) Parameter analysis for transmission rate (beta),  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of primary set countries.
3) Compare the GSI and google mobility,  using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases and 'Global_Mobility_Report.csv' for google mobility data. The file of Google mobility data is too large to upload here, but it is available to dowload for everyone at https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/ .
4) Calculate the average error, using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of primary set countries, and using the 'GSI_and_cases_track.csv' to describe the real data in GSI and the number of confirmed cases of validation set countries.
